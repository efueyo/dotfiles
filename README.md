# dotfiles

My dotfiles and some utils

Some of the tools and configurations I use.

- Wezterm
- Fish as the shell
- Starship as the shell prompt
- Tmux
- Nvim

Install with `make install`

Dont forget to install the fonts with `./etc/fonts.sh`

## old MacOS

Other scripts to complete in Makefile:

```
  brew install tmux
  brew install --cask font-hack-nerd-font
  ln -sfv ${PWD}/.tmux.conf ~/.tmux.conf
```
